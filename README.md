# Welcome to Botnuki!

I made this bot as a quick solution for InukiTV, a discord server I help manage.

So far, the functionallity is as follows:

/roleadd [rolename1] [rolename2] [etc] - add a role or several roles to your user profile
/roleremove [rolename1] [rolename2] [etc] - remove a role or several roles to your user profile

The roles authorized for adding or removal are as follows: Smite, League, Paladins, Battlerite, and Ark.

More features will be added to this bot when determined necessary!
