# Welcome to Botnuki!

I created this quick project as a solution for public role management on the InukiTV Discord.

There are 5 primary roles that we want to allow users to give themselves: Smite, League, Paladins, Battlerite and Ark. If they try to add any others, the bot won't add the role.

Users are also able to add more than one role at a time.

The commands presently available are as follows:

/roleadd [rolename1] [rolename2] [etc]

/roleremove [rolename1] [rolename2] [etc]

More features will be added on a case-by-case basis.
